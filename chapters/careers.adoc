== Careers
[[careers]]

With all this effort learning cyber skills, you might be wondering how to use and practice them. There are many different career paths in cybersecurity, and they all require different skills. Some of the most common careers in cybersecurity are as analysts, engineers, and penetration testers. 

Organizations need people who can analyze data and find patterns, people who can design and build systems, and people who can test those systems for vulnerabilities. One approach is with 'red' and 'blue' teams. Red teams are offensive, and they try to break into systems. Blue teams are defensive, and they try to protect systems from attacks. Both teams are important, and they work together to make sure that systems are secure.

It's also possible to pursue a career more independently, as a consultant or freelancer. This can be a good option for people who want to work on their own schedule and have more control over their work.

The National Security Agency (NSA) also contributes to training through the RING program - Regions Investing in the Next Generation. Here's an interactive exercise from them: https://d2hie3dpn9wvbb.cloudfront.net/NSA+Ring+Project/index.html[https://d2hie3dpn9wvbb.cloudfront.net/NSA+Ring+Project/index.html, window="_blank"]

=== Bug Bounties
[[bounties]]

One way vulnerabilities are reduced is through bug bounty programs, in which organizations offer rewards to their employees or the public for finding vulnerabilities and reporting them to be fixed. 

This is beneficial to the organization because it allows them to find and fix vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious actors. Many companies have bug bounty programs, and many people are safer because of the security flaws that have been found and fixed through them.

Bug bounty programs are also beneficial to hackers as they can earn money legitimately while practicing their skills and helping others be more secure.

Some bug bounty programs include:

- Bugcrowd: https://www.bugcrowd.com/programs/[https://www.bugcrowd.com/programs/, window="_blank"]

- Mozilla: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/, window="_blank"]

Even governments offer bounties!

=== The CVE® Program
[[cves]]

When a vulnerability is found, it is assigned a CVE number, which is a unique identifier for that vulnerability. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, and it is a list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. CVEs are assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). 

By defining and cataloging vulnerabilities, security researchers, engineers, and analysts can more easily communicate about them to each other. Imagine trying to fix a problem without knowing what to call it!

The list of CVEs, and forms to submit or update them, can be found at https://www.cve.org[https://www.cve.org, window="_blank"].


=== Ethical Considerations
[[ethical-considerations]]

Before publishing a vulnerability from a bug bounty program, or as a CVE, you should consider the ethical implications of doing so.

If a vulnerability is published before it is fixed, it could be exploited by malicious actors. This could cause harm to people or organizations, as well as legal consequences for the publisher. Each organization or program will have its own rules and preferences for how to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. 

Additionally, never hack into a system without permission, or attempt to go further than requested. This is illegal, and it could similarly cause harm to people or organizations. Bug bounty programs will define clear scopes for what is allowed.

If the organization does not respond to a disclosure of a security risk to them or their users within a reasonable timeframe, there may be other options such as contacting a governing agency. In the United States, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a good place to start: https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process[https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process, window="_blank"]. 

If a malicous actor is able to find and exploit an unreported vulnerability, it is known as a 'zero-day', because the organization has had zero days to fix it. These are considered the most dangerous, and can impact millions of innocent people. Ultimately, careers in cybersecurity are all about preventing these from hapening.

While this Primer cannot cover all the ethical considerations of reporting individual vulnerabilities, it is important to consider your ability to help others through responsible disclosure.
